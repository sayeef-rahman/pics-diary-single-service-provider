                <p>
                    Google Firebase is a realtime database. It allows secure access to the database directly from client-side code so thet we can build rich, collaborative applications. Firebase persist data locally, if we are also in offline. Realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience. When the device is connected to the internet the Realtime Database synchronizes the local data changes with the remote updates that occurred while the client was offline, merging any conflicts automatically. The Realtime Database provides a flexible, expression-based rules language, called Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules, to define how your data should be structured and when data can be read from or written to. When integrated with Firebase Authentication, developers can define who has access to what data, and how they can access it.
